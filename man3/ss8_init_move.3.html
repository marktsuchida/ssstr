[1mNAME[0m
       ss8_init_move,  ss8_init_move_destroy - initialize an ssstr byte string
       by moving the value of another byte string

[1mDESCRIPTION[0m
       [1mss8_init_move[22m() initializes the [1mss8str [22mobject that [4mstr[24m points  to,  and
       sets  its value to that of the [1mss8str [22mobject at [4msrc[24m.  The object at [4msrc[0m
       remains valid but its value becomes indeterminate.

       [1mss8_init_move_destroy[22m() is like [1mss8_init_move[22m(), except that the [1mss8str[0m
       object at [4msrc[24m becomes invalid (destroyed) after the move; that is,

           [1mss8_init_move_destroy([4m[22mstr[24m[1m, [4m[22msrc[24m[1m);[0m

       is equivalent to

           [1mss8_init_move([4m[22mstr[24m[1m, [4m[22msrc[24m[1m);[0m
           [1mss8_destroy([4m[22msrc[24m[1m);[0m

       For both functions, behavior is undefined unless [4mstr[24m points to  an  in‐
       valid  [1mss8str  [22mobject, [4msrc[24m points to a valid [1mss8str [22mobject, and [4mstr[24m and
       [4msrc[24m point to distinct objects.

       No memory allocation or deallocation is performed.

[1mRETURN VALUE[0m
       [1mss8_init_move[22m() and [1mss8_init_move_destroy[22m() return [4mstr[24m.

[1mNOTES[0m
       Care should be taken not to use the value of the [1mss8str [22mobject  at  [4msrc[0m
       after   the   move.   It  must  still  be  destroyed  in  the  case  of
       [1mss8_init_move[22m().
