[1mDESCRIPTION[0m
       [1mss8_find_first_of[22m() finds the first occurrence of any of the bytes that
       appear in the [1mss8str [22mat [4mneedles[24m, in the [1mss8str [22mat [4mhaystack[24m.  The search
       begins at byte position [4mstart[24m.  Behavior is undefined  unless  [4mhaystack[0m
       and  [4mneedles[24m  both point to valid [1mss8str [22mobjects and [4mstart[24m is less than
       or equal to the length of the haystack string.

       [1mss8_find_first_of_cstr[22m() is  like  [1mss8_find_first_of[22m()  but  finds  the
       first occurrence of any of the bytes that appear in the null-terminated
       byte string [4mneedles[24m.  Behavior is undefined unless [4mhaystack[24m points to a
       valid  [1mss8str  [22mobject, [4mstart[24m is less than or equal to the length of the
       haystack string, and [4mneedles[24m is a null-terminated byte string.

       [1mss8_find_first_of_bytes[22m() is like  [1mss8_find_first_of[22m()  but  finds  the
       first  occurrence of any of the bytes that appear in the byte string of
       length [4mcount[24m located at [4mneedles[24m.  Behavior is undefined unless [4mhaystack[0m
       points to a valid [1mss8str [22mobject, [4mstart[24m is less than  or  equal  to  the
       length of the haystack string, and [4mneedles[24m is not NULL and points to an
       array of at least [4mcount[24m bytes.

       [1mss8_find_first_not_of[22m(),        [1mss8_find_first_not_of_cstr[22m(),       and
       [1mss8_find_first_not_of_bytes[22m()  are  like  the  corresponding  functions
       without the [1mnot [22min the name, except that they find the first occurrence
       of a byte that does not appear in [4mneedles[24m.

       [1mss8_find_last_of[22m(),             [1mss8_find_last_of_cstr[22m(),            and
       [1mss8_find_last_of_bytes[22m() are  like  the  corresponding  functions  with
       [1mfirst  [22minstead  of [1mlast [22min the name, except that they find the last oc‐
       currence of a byte that appears in [4mneedles[24m.

       [1mss8_find_last_not_of[22m(),        [1mss8_find_last_not_of_cstr[22m(),         and
       [1mss8_find_last_not_of_bytes[22m() are like the corresponding functions with‐
       out the [1mnot [22min the name, except that they find the last occurrence of a
       byte that does not appear in [4mneedles[24m.

[1mRETURN VALUE[0m
       All  12  functions  return the position, counting from the beginning of
       the haystack string, of the matching byte.  If  there  is  no  matching
       byte, [1mSIZE_MAX [22mis returned.
