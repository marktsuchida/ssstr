[1mDESCRIPTION[0m
       [1mss8_capacity[22m() queries the [1mss8str [22mat [4mstr[24m for its capacity, which is the
       maximum length of the byte string that it can hold without the need  to
       allocate additional (or any) dynamic storage.

       [1mss8_reserve[22m() ensures that the [1mss8str [22mat [4mstr[24m has at least the given [4mca‐[0m
       [4mpacity[24m  by  enlarging its buffer if necessary.  The length and contents
       of the string do not change.  [1mss8_reserve[22m() never lessens the capacity.

       Reserving capacity ahead of time can improve efficiency  when  a  large
       number  of  insertions, concatenations, or replacements are about to be
       performed and the final length of the string is known, either precisely
       or approximately.

       Reserved  capacity  is  not  available  length;  writing  to  [1mss8_muta‐[0m
       [1mble_cstr([4m[22mstr[24m[1m)  [22mbeyond the length of [1m*[4m[22mstr[24m results in undefined behavior.
       See [1mss8_set_len[22m(3) for ways to change the available length.

       [1mss8_shrink_to_fit[22m() reallocates the internal buffer of  the  [1mss8str  [22mat
       [4mstr[24m so that it is the minimum size required to hold its contents.

       Shrinking  to fit may improve memory usage if an [1mss8str [22mis shortened by
       a large factor and then retained for a long duration.

       Behavior of these 3 functions is undefined unless [4mstr[24m points to a valid
       [1mss8str [22mobject.

[1mRETURN VALUE[0m
       [1mss8_capacity[22m() returns the maximum length of the byte string  that  the
       [1mss8str [22mpointed to by [4mstr[24m can hold without allocating additional dynamic
       storage.

       [1mss8_reserve[22m() and [1mss8_shrink_to_fit[22m() return [4mstr[24m.

[1mNOTES[0m
       The  capacity  of  an [1mss8str [22mis never zero but has a platform-dependent
       fixed minimum.  Therefore, the capacity after performing

           [1mss8_shrink_to_fit(ss8_clear([4m[22mstr[24m[1m));[0m

       is guaranteed to be greater than zero.  This also means that the capac‐
       ity   does   not   necessarily   match   the   length   after   calling
       [1mss8_shrink_to_fit[22m().

       In  general,  [1mss8str [22mfunctions that assign (copy) a string reserve just
       the capacity needed for the destination string.  Functions that insert,
       append, or replace a substring heuristically grow the  capacity  in  an
       attempt  to  minimize reallocation.  When a function shortens a string,
       or does not require more than its current capacity, it does  not  alter
       its  capacity.  Only a call to [1mss8_shrink_to_fit[22m() decreases the capac‐
       ity of an [1mss8str[22m.
