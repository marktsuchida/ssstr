[1mDESCRIPTION[0m
       [1mss8_replace[22m()  replaces the substring of the [1mss8str [22mat [4mdest[24m starting at
       byte position [4mstart[24m and having length up to [4mlen[24m (limited by the  length
       of the destination string) with the contents of the [1mss8str [22mat [4msrc[24m.  Be‐
       havior  is  undefined  unless  [4mdest[24m and [4msrc[24m point to valid and distinct
       [1mss8str [22mobjects and [4mpos[24m is less than or equal to the length of the  des‐
       tination string.

       [1mss8_replace_cstr[22m()  replaces the substring of the [1mss8str [22mat [4mdest[24m start‐
       ing at byte position [4mstart[24m and having length up to [4mlen[24m with  the  null-
       terminated  byte  string [4msrc[24m.  Behavior is undefined unless [4mdest[24m points
       to a valid [1mss8str [22mobject, [4mpos[24m is less than or equal to  the  length  of
       the  destination  string, and [4msrc[24m is a null-terminated byte string that
       does not overlap with the internal buffer of [4mdest[24m.

       [1mss8_replace_bytes[22m() replaces the substring of the [1mss8str [22mat [4mdest[24m start‐
       ing at byte position [4mstart[24m and having length up to [4mlen[24m  with  the  byte
       string  of  length [4msrclen[24m located at [4msrc[24m.  Behavior is undefined unless
       [4mdest[24m points to a valid [1mss8str [22mobject, [4mpos[24m is less than or equal to  the
       length  of the destination string, and [4msrc[24m is not NULL and points to an
       array of at least [4msrclen[24m bytes that does not overlap with the  internal
       buffer of [4mdest[24m.

       [1mss8_replace_ch[22m()  replaces the substring of the [1mss8str [22mat [4mdest[24m starting
       at byte position [4mstart[24m and having length up to [4mlen[24m with the single byte
       [4mch[24m.  Behavior is undefined unless [4mdest[24m points to a valid [1mss8str  [22mobject
       and [4mpos[24m is less than or equal to the length of the destination string.

       [1mss8_replace_ch_n[22m()  replaces the substring of the [1mss8str [22mat [4mdest[24m start‐
       ing at byte position [4mstart[24m and having  length  up  to  [4mlen[24m  with  [4mcount[0m
       copies  of  the byte [4mch[24m.  Behavior is undefined unless [4mdest[24m points to a
       valid [1mss8str [22mobject and [4mpos[24m is less than or equal to the length of  the
       destination string.
