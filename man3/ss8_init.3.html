[1mDESCRIPTION[0m
       [1mss8_init[22m()  initializes  the [1mss8str [22mobject that [4mstr[24m points to.  The ob‐
       ject becomes valid and its value is set to the empty string.  No memory
       allocation is performed.  Behavior is undefined unless [4mstr[24m points to an
       invalid (that is, uninitialized or previously destroyed) [1mss8str [22mobject.

       For global or static variables, [1mSS8_STATIC_INITIALIZER [22mcan be used as a
       static initialization value instead of calling [1mss8_init[22m().  Note that a
       zero-initialized [1mss8str [22mobject is not valid.

       All valid [1mss8str [22mobjects must be destroyed by calling [1mss8_destroy[22m() af‐
       ter last use; otherwise dynamically allocated memory may be leaked.

       [1mss8_destroy[22m() destroys the [1mss8str [22mobject that [4mstr[24m points to, deallocat‐
       ing any associated dynamic storage.  Behavior is undefined  unless  [4mstr[0m
       points to a valid [1mss8str [22mobject.

       A  destroyed [1mss8str [22mobject is invalid and must be re-initialized before
       reuse.

[1mRETURN VALUE[0m
       [1mss8_init[22m() returns [4mstr[24m.

[1mNOTES[0m
       [1mSS8_STATIC_INITIALIZER [22mworks also for initializing local or dynamically
       allocated variables.  However, it can result in less efficient code be‐
       ing generated when compared to calling [1mss8_init[22m().
