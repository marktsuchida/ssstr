[1mDESCRIPTION[0m
       [1mss8_insert[22m()  inserts  the  [1mss8str  [22mat  [4msrc[24m at byte position [4mpos[24m of the
       [1mss8str [22mat [4mdest[24m.  Behavior is undefined unless [4mdest[24m  and  [4msrc[24m  point  to
       valid  and distinct [1mss8str [22mobjects and [4mpos[24m is less than or equal to the
       length of the destination string.

       [1mss8_insert_cstr[22m() inserts the null-terminated byte string [4msrc[24m  at  byte
       position  [4mpos[24m of the [1mss8str [22mat [4mdest[24m.  Behavior is undefined unless [4mdest[0m
       points to a valid [1mss8str [22mobject, [4mpos[24m is  less  than  or  equal  to  the
       length  of  the  destination  string, and [4msrc[24m is a null-terminated byte
       string that does not overlap with the internal buffer of [4mdest[24m.

       [1mss8_insert_bytes[22m() inserts the byte string of length [4msrclen[24m located  at
       [4msrc[24m  at byte position [4mpos[24m of the [1mss8str [22mat [4mdest[24m.  Behavior is undefined
       unless [4mdest[24m points to a valid [1mss8str [22mobject, [4mpos[24m is less than or  equal
       to the length of the destination string, and [4msrc[24m is not NULL and points
       to an array of at least [4msrclen[24m bytes that does not overlap with the in‐
       ternal buffer of [4mdest[24m.

       [1mss8_insert_ch[22m()  inserts the single byte [4mch[24m at byte position [4mpos[24m of the
       [1mss8str [22mat [4mdest[24m.  Behavior is undefined unless [4mdest[24m points  to  a  valid
       [1mss8str [22mobject and [4mpos[24m is less than or equal to the length of the desti‐
       nation string.

       [1mss8_insert_ch_n[22m()  inserts [4mcount[24m copies of the byte [4mch[24m at byte position
       [4mpos[24m of the [1mss8str [22mat [4mdest[24m.  Behavior is undefined unless [4mdest[24m points to
       a valid [1mss8str [22mobject and [4mpos[24m is less than or equal to  the  length  of
       the destination string.
