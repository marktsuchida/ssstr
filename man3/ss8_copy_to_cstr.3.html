[1mDESCRIPTION[0m
       [1mss8_copy_to_cstr[22m() copies the contents of the  [1mss8str  [22mat  [4mstr[24m  to  the
       buffer  located at [4mbuf[24m, and appends a null byte.  At most [4mbufsize[24m bytes
       are written, including the null terminator; if [4mbufsize[24m  is  not  suffi‐
       cient to hold the string, the copied string is truncated at [4mbufsize[24m [1m- 1[0m
       bytes.

       Behavior  is  undefined unless [4mstr[24m is a valid [1mss8str [22mobject, [4mbuf[24m points
       to a buffer of at least [4mbufsize[24m bytes that does not  overlap  with  the
       internal buffer of [4mstr[24m, and [4mbufsize[24m is greater than or equal to 1.

       [1mss8_copy_to_bytes[22m()  copies  the  contents  of the [1mss8str [22mat [4mstr[24m to the
       buffer located at [4mbuf[24m.  No null terminator is appended.  At  most  [4mbuf‐[0m
       [4msize[24m  bytes  are  written;  if  [4mbufsize[24m  is  not sufficient to hold the
       string, the copied string is truncated at [4mbufsize[24m bytes.

       Behavior is undefined unless [4mstr[24m is  a  valid  [1mss8str  [22mobject  and  [4mbuf[0m
       points to a buffer of at least [4mbufsize[24m bytes that does not overlap with
       the internal buffer of [4mstr[24m.

[1mRETURN VALUE[0m
       [1mss8_copy_to_cstr[22m()  and [1mss8_copy_to_bytes[22m() return [1mtrue [22mif the whole of
       the string [4mstr[24m was copied.  If the string had to be truncated, they re‐
       turn [1mfalse[22m.
