[1mNAME[0m
       ss8_len, ss8_is_empty - query length of ssstr byte string

[1mSYNOPSIS[0m
       [1m#include &lt;ss8str.h&gt;[0m

       [1msize_t ss8_len(ss8str const *[4m[22mstr[24m[1m);[0m
       [1mbool   ss8_is_empty(ss8str const *[4m[22mstr[24m[1m);[0m

[1mDESCRIPTION[0m
       [1mss8_len[22m() queries the length of the [1mss8str [22mpointed to by [4mstr[24m.

       [1mss8_is_empty[22m()  tests  whether  the  [1mss8str [22mpointed to by [4mstr[24m is empty,
       that is, has a length of zero.

       For either function, behavior is undefined unless [4mstr[24m points to a valid
       [1mss8str [22mobject.

       The length of an [1mss8str [22mis stored explicitly and is not affected by the
       byte string it contains.  Specifically, if the byte string contains em‐
       bedded null bytes, its length will differ from what [1mstrlen[22m() would  re‐
       turn when called on the equivalent string.

[1mRETURN VALUE[0m
       [1mss8_len[22m()  returns  the length, in bytes, of the string at [4mstr[24m, not in‐
       cluding the null terminator that would  be  part  of  the  string  when
       viewed  as  a  null-terminated byte string.  Any embedded null bytes in
       the string do not affect the length.

       [1mss8_is_empty[22m() returns [1mtrue [22mwhen [4mstr[24m has a length of zero; otherwise it
       returns [1mfalse[22m.
