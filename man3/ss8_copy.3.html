[1mDESCRIPTION[0m
       [1mss8_copy[22m() copies the value of the [1mss8str [22mobject at [4msrc[24m to  the  [1mss8str[0m
       object  at  [4mdest[24m.  Behavior is undefined unless [4mdest[24m and [4msrc[24m point to a
       valid and distinct [1mss8str [22mobjects.

       [1mss8_copy_cstr[22m() copies the  null-terminated  byte  string  [4msrc[24m  to  the
       [1mss8str  [22mobject  at [4mdest[24m.  Behavior is undefined unless [4mdest[24m points to a
       valid [1mss8str [22mobject and [4msrc[24m is a null-terminated byte string that  does
       not overlap with the internal buffer of [4mdest[24m.

       [1mss8_copy_bytes[22m() copies the byte string of length [4msrclen[24m located at [4msrc[0m
       to the [1mss8str [22mobject at [4mdest[24m.  Behavior is undefined unless [4mdest[24m points
       to  a valid [1mss8str [22mobject and [4msrc[24m is not NULL and points to an array of
       at least [4msrclen[24m bytes that does not overlap with the internal buffer of
       [4mdest[24m.

       [1mss8_copy_ch[22m() assigns the string consisting of the single  byte  [4mch[24m  to
       the [1mss8str [22mobject at [4mdest[24m.  Behavior is undefined unless [4mdest[24m points to
       a valid [1mss8str [22mobject.

       [1mss8_copy_ch_n[22m()  assigns  the  string consisting of [4mcount[24m copies of the
       byte [4mch[24m to the [1mss8str [22mobject at [4mdest[24m.   Behavior  is  undefined  unless
       [4mdest[24m points to a valid [1mss8str [22mobject.

[1mRETURN VALUE[0m
       All 5 functions return [4mdest[24m.
