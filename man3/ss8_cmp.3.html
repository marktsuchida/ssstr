[1mDESCRIPTION[0m
       [1mss8_cmp[22m() compares the [1mss8str [22mat [4mlhs[24m with the [1mss8str [22mat [4mrhs[24m.   Behavior
       is undefined unless both [4mlhs[24m and [4mrhs[24m point to valid [1mss8str [22mobjects.

       [1mss8_cmp_cstr[22m() compares the [1mss8str [22mat [4mlhs[24m with the null-terminated byte
       string  [4mrhs[24m.  Behavior is undefined unless [4mlhs[24m points to a valid [1mss8str[0m
       object and [4mrhs[24m is a null-terminated byte string.

       [1mss8_cmp_bytes[22m() compares the [1mss8str [22mat [4mlhs[24m  with  the  byte  string  of
       length  [4mrhslen[24m located at [4mrhs[24m.  Behavior is undefined unless [4mlhs[24m points
       to a valid [1mss8str [22mobject and [4mrhs[24m is not NULL and points to an array  of
       at least [4mrhslen[24m bytes.

       [1mss8_cmp_ch[22m() compares the [1mss8str [22mat [4mlhs[24m with the byte string consisting
       of  the  single byte [4mrhs.[24m  Behavior is undefined unless [4mlhs[24m points to a
       valid [1mss8str [22mobject.

[1mRETURN VALUE[0m
       All 4 functions return a negative, zero,  or  positive  value,  respec‐
       tively,  if [4mlhs[24m is less than, equal to, or greater than [4mrhs[24m, in a byte-
       wise lexicographical comparison.

[1mNOTES[0m
       The byte-wise lexicographical comparison performed by  these  functions
       does not take into account the encoding of the strings.  If the strings
       are  UTF-8-encoded,  the comparison will be equivalent to a code-point-
       wise lexicographical comparison, but will not take into account canoni‐
       cal equivalents if the strings are not normalized ahead of time.
