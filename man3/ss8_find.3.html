[1mDESCRIPTION[0m
       [1mss8_find[22m()  finds  the  first  occurrence of the substring equal to the
       [1mss8str [22mat [4mneedle[24m in the [1mss8str [22mat [4mhaystack[24m.  Only matches that begin at
       or after the byte position [4mstart[24m are considered.  Behavior is undefined
       unless [4mhaystack[24m and [4mneedle[24m both point to valid [1mss8str [22mobjects and [4mstart[0m
       is less than or equal to the length of the haystack string.

       [1mss8_find_cstr[22m() is like [1mss8_find[22m() but finds the  first  occurrence  of
       the  null-terminated  byte string [4mneedle[24m.  Behavior is undefined unless
       [4mhaystack[24m points to a valid [1mss8str [22mobject, [4mstart[24m is less than  or  equal
       to  the  length of the haystack string, and [4mneedle[24m is a null-terminated
       byte string.

       [1mss8_find_bytes[22m() is like [1mss8_find[22m() but finds the first  occurrence  of
       the byte string of length [4mneedlelen[24m located at [4mneedle[24m.  Behavior is un‐
       defined  unless [4mhaystack[24m points to a valid [1mss8str [22mobject, [4mstart[24m is less
       than or equal to the length of the haystack string, and [4mneedle[24m  is  not
       NULL and points to an array of at least [4mneedlelen[24m bytes.

       [1mss8_find_ch[22m()  is like [1mss8_find[22m() but finds the first occurrence of the
       byte [4mneedle[24m.  Behavior is undefined unless [4mhaystack[24m points to  a  valid
       [1mss8str  [22mobject  and  [4mstart[24m  is  less than or equal to the length of the
       haystack string.

       [1mss8_find_not_ch[22m() is like [1mss8_find_ch[22m() except that it finds the  first
       occurrence of a byte that is not equal to [4mneedle[24m.

       [1mss8_rfind[22m(),  [1mss8_rfind_cstr[22m(),  [1mss8_rfind_bytes[22m(), [1mss8_rfind_ch[22m(), and
       [1mss8_rfind_not_ch[22m() are like the corresponding functions without  the  [1mr[0m
       in  the name, except that they find the last, rather than first, occur‐
       rence of [4mneedle[24m.  Only matches that begin at or before the  byte  posi‐
       tion [4mstart[24m are considered.

[1mRETURN VALUE[0m
       All  10  functions  return the position, counting from the beginning of
       the haystack string, of the first byte of the match.  If  there  is  no
       match, [1mSIZE_MAX [22mis returned.

       If [4mneedle[24m is the empty string, [4mstart[24m is returned.
