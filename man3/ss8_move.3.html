[1mNAME[0m
       ss8_move, ss8_move_destroy - move one ssstr byte string to another

[1mSYNOPSIS[0m
       [1m#include &lt;ss8str.h&gt;[0m

       [1mss8str *ss8_move(ss8str *restrict [4m[22mdest[24m[1m, ss8str *restrict [4m[22msrc[24m[1m);[0m
       [1mss8str *ss8_move_destroy(ss8str *restrict [4m[22mdest[24m[1m,[0m
                                [1mss8str *restrict [4m[22msrc[24m[1m);[0m

[1mDESCRIPTION[0m
       [1mss8_move[22m() takes the value of the [1mss8str [22mobject at [4msrc[24m and places it in
       the  [1mss8str  [22mobject  at [4mdest[24m.  After the move, the [1mss8str [22mobject at [4msrc[0m
       remains valid but its value becomes indeterminate.

       [1mss8_move_destroy[22m() is like [1mss8_move[22m(), except that the [1mss8str [22mobject at
       [4msrc[24m becomes invalid (destroyed) after the move; that is,

           [1mss8_move_destroy([4m[22mdest[24m[1m, [4m[22msrc[24m[1m);[0m

       is equivalent to

           [1mss8_move([4m[22mdest[24m[1m, [4m[22msrc[24m[1m);[0m
           [1mss8_destroy([4m[22msrc[24m[1m);[0m

       For both functions, behavior is undefined unless [4mdest[24m and [4msrc[24m point  to
       valid and distinct [1mss8str [22mobjects.

       No memory allocation is performed, but deallocation may be performed.

[1mRETURN VALUE[0m
       [1mss8_move[22m() and [1mss8_move_destroy[22m() return [4mdest[24m.

[1mNOTES[0m
       Care  should  be taken not to use the value of the [1mss8str [22mobject at [4msrc[0m
       after the move.  It must still be destroyed in the case of [1mss8_move[22m().
