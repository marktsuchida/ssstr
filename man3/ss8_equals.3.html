[1mDESCRIPTION[0m
       [1mss8_equals[22m() tests whether the [1mss8str [22mat [4mlhs[24m is equal to the [1mss8str  [22mat
       [4mrhs[24m.   Behavior  is  undefined  unless  [4mlhs[24m and [4mrhs[24m both point to valid
       [1mss8str [22mobjects.

       [1mss8_equals_cstr[22m() tests whether the [1mss8str [22mat [4mlhs[24m is equal to the null-
       terminated byte string [4mrhs[24m.  Behavior is undefined unless [4mlhs[24m points to
       a valid [1mss8str [22mobject and [4mrhs[24m is a null-terminated byte string.

       [1mss8_equals_bytes[22m() tests whether the [1mss8str [22mat [4mlhs[24m is equal to the byte
       string with length [4mrhslen[24m located at [4mrhs[24m.  Behavior is undefined unless
       [4mlhs[24m points to a valid [1mss8str [22mobject and [4mrhs[24m is not NULL and  points  to
       an array of at least [4mrhslen[24m bytes.

       [1mss8_equals_ch[22m()  tests  whether  the [1mss8str [22mat [4mlhs[24m is equal to the byte
       string consisting of the single byte [4mrhs[24m.  Behavior is undefined unless
       [4mlhs[24m points to a valid [1mss8str [22mobject.

       Two byte strings are considered equal when they have  the  same  length
       and are byte-wise equal.

[1mRETURN VALUE[0m
       All  4 functions return [1mtrue [22mif [4mlhs[24m is equal to [4mrhs[24m; otherwise they re‐
       turn [1mfalse[22m.

[1mNOTES[0m
       The equality comparison performed by these functions does not take into
       account the possibility of different byte  sequences  representing  the
       same  character.  If the strings are UTF-8-encoded, canonically-equiva‐
       lent strings may not be considered equal by these functions unless  the
       strings are normalized ahead of time.
