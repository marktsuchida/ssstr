[1mDESCRIPTION[0m
       The  [1mss8_cstr[22m() family of functions provide direct access to the inter‐
       nal buffer of the [1mss8str [22mthat [4mstr[24m points to.

       [1mss8_cstr[22m() and [1mss8_mutable_cstr[22m() return the pointer to  the  beginning
       of the string buffer.  A null terminator is always placed after the end
       of  the buffer.  [1mss8_cstr_suffix[22m() and [1mss8_mutable_cstr_suffix[22m() return
       a pointer offsetted by [4mstart[24m bytes, corresponding to a  suffix  of  the
       string.   Calling  [1mss8_cstr[22m()  or  [1mss8_mutable_cstr[22m()  is equivalent to
       calling [1mss8_cstr_suffix[22m() or  [1mss8_mutable_cstr_suffix[22m(),  respectively,
       with [4mstart[24m set to zero.

       Behavior  is  undefined unless [4mstr[24m points to a valid [1mss8str [22mobject, and
       [4mstart[24m is less than or equal to the length of the string.

       [1mss8_cstr[22m() and [1mss8_cstr_suffix[22m() are suitable for passing the  contents
       of  an  [1mss8str [22mto a function expecting a read-only null-terminated byte
       string, or a read-only byte string with length at  most  equal  to  the
       length  of [4mstr[24m (as determined by [1mss8_len[22m() and subtracting [4mstart[24m in the
       case of [1mss8_cstr_suffix[22m()).

       [1mss8_mutable_cstr[22m() and [1mss8_mutable_cstr_suffix[22m() allow the  use  of  an
       [1mss8str  [22mas the destination when calling a function that fills a caller-
       provided buffer with a null-terminated  or  bound-length  byte  string.
       The  available  buffer  size can be adjusted with [1mss8_set_len[22m() before‐
       hand, and the same function, or [1mss8_set_len_to_cstrlen[22m(), can  be  used
       afterwards  to crop the string to the desired length, if necessary.  In
       the case of [1mss8_mutable_cstr_suffix[22m(), [4mstart[24m must  be  subtracted  from
       the available length.

       It  is permissible to write 1 byte more than the available length, pro‐
       vided that the last byte written is always a null byte.

       See [1mss8_set_len[22m(3) for examples.

[1mRETURN VALUE[0m
       All 4 functions return a pointer to the internal string buffer  of  the
       [1mss8str  [22mpointed to by [4mstr[24m, offset by [4mstart[24m if applicable.  The returned
       pointer remains valid as long as the [1mss8str [22mat [4mstr[24m  remains  valid  and
       unmodified.
