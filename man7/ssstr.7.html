[1mNAME[0m
       ssstr, ss8str - short-string-optimized byte string routines

[1mSYNOPSIS[0m
       [1m#include &lt;ss8str.h&gt;[0m

[1mDESCRIPTION[0m
       [1mssstr  [22mis  a header-only library for representing and manipulating byte
       strings.

   [1mString representation[0m
       Strings are represented by the opaque type [1mss8str[22m,  which  is  suitable
       for  use  as  a regular automatic (stack) variable, or as a member of a
       larger data structure.  (It is 32 bytes  on  64-bit  platforms  and  16
       bytes on 32-bit platforms.)

       When  the  string is small, it is stored directly in the [1mss8str [22mobject;
       otherwise, dynamic (heap) storage is allocated to store the string.

       The [1mss8str [22mstores the length of the  string  explicitly,  allowing  the
       handling  of  strings  that  contain embedded null bytes in addition to
       more efficient operations.

       Objects of type [1mss8str [22mmust be initialized before use and destroyed af‐
       ter use, exactly once each.  See [1mss8_init[22m(3) and [1mss8_destroy[22m(3).
